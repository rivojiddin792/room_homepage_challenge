### What I learned

This challenge has a new thing for me, i have toggeled 2 class between several elements, but now i have to toggle one class (hidden) amoung three divs with only one does not have that class to be visible and make it in a loop. like a slideshow controlled by buttons. 

i was structuring it in my mind of how to do it, i was able to change them, but to make a loop of them is tricky, eventually with help of gemini, it works, but the good thing is that it was nothing other big function, it was all if/else statement, but just needed some adjustments. 

this one does not have much sections so i was having trouble in screen responsiveness for the tabs. and designing it takes double time then it should.

### Continued development

For now i need to start with frontend but i'm going to continue backend devoloping and then if everything goes correctly then will countinue either in robotics coding and developement or in gaming industry.
